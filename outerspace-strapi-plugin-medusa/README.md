#### Key Features:
- Fetches Medusa data into Strapi for extended content management.
- Allows users to manage multilingual content (i18n) for Medusa products.
- Supports handling of images and product media, leveraging Strapi's robust media capabilities.
- Adds custom fields and attributes to Medusa objects within Strapi for enhanced product sheets.
